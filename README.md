# MVP 

## Game

- Number of players: minimum - 4; maximum - 10

- Entry frame: One button to create game ("Host"); one button to join hosted game ("Join")

- Host button: redirects to a new view with a form to identify number of players; generates game ID; view has "Start" button

- Join button: redirects to a new view with a form to input the game ID. Submitting the game ID redirects to a form asking for a user name before redirecting to a 'Player screen' ('lobby'), which will be displayed to all until the host starts the game.

- Start button: redirects to the view 'Write something' (form) 

- 'Write Something" View has a 'Done' button. As soon as every player has hit the 'Done'button on their screen, the next view is rendered (each player view calls the db, filling up player-slots, db listens to all slots filling up (see Rubin for details)). The next view will either be the Draw view, or the Gallery view.

- Write Something - Done: Triggers a view with the previous player's written prompt; 'Done' button (for draw screen).

- Draw on prompt - similar behaviour to 'Write Something' view.

Alternate between the two views every time the db slots fill up on 'Done', until player.length has been reached.

If no more rounds to play, render view with gallery of all drawings belonging to the player's own prompt.

## Separate client/server

The boilerplate is also set up to host the client using `webpack-dev-server` with hot module reloading etc. To use this method, in one terminal run:
```sh
npm run client
```
and in the other:
```sh
npm run server
```
The client will be available on http://localhost:3000 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
